Hi, I'm Prakruti! I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Vision at Carnegie Mellon University. I dream of building robust and useful consumer products using computer vision. 

My tryst with image processing and computer vision began with an undergraduate internship in a healthcare company. Some neat mathematics followed and I built a useful tool. Fast forward a few years - the elegant mathematics involved and the numerous possible applications of vision, motivate me to continue learning. 

I really enjoy working in teams and in the past have combined this with two of my passions, [music](https://prakruti.github.io/misc/Music.html) (with my A Cappella group) and [basketball](https://prakruti.github.io/misc/Basketball.html) (with the IIT Madras team).
