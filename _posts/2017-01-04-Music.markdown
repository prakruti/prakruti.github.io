Childhood memories of road travel with my family would be imcomplete without the lilting tunes from All India Radio in our car. My parents noticed that I enjoyed singing along to them and got me enrolled in Hindustani Music Classes. 

I found my space musically, during the course of my stay at IIT Madras. Insti - as it is affectionately referred to, provides a welcoming atmosphere for the musically inclined freshman. Here are some of my performances at the inter-hostel band competition.

Being part of my A Cappella Group - Vocal Fry was an experience I cherish.Here's a recording of us performing a Michael Jackson medley.

In my final year, I was Convener of [IIT Madras Music Club](https://www.facebook.com/IitmMusicClub/?fref=ts). My responsibilities included organising events for our cultural festival -Saarang, and competitions for our IITM's inter-hostel cultural trophy - the Lit-Soc trophy. My personal contribution to the music scene was introducing inclusive events like Antakshari, Drum Circle and On-the-spot composition events!
