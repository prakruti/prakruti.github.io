In this project, the goal was to segment out a tumor from a CT Scan. The algorithm allowed for some interaction between from a doctor. I used the Random-Walker algorithm which accepts a few labeled foreground and background pixels as input. 

The image is then modeled as a circuit. 

Matrix inversions.
